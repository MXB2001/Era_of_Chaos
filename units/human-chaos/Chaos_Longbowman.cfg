    description= _ "Even though the Chaos Empireâ€™s soldiers are more adept at fighting hand-to-hand, they also understand the importance of being able to keep their adversaries at bay and take them down before they can retaliate. Chaos Longbowmen carry more powerful weapons than the average archer; the subtle improvements made to their bows and arrowheads enable their projectiles to fly farther and penetrate even thick armor. Making matters worse are the lethal fluids of dubious origin into which the arrows are dipped prior to shooting."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
