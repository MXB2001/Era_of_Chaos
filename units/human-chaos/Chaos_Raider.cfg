    description= _ "For most desert dwellers, horses and other equines have become an increasingly scarce commodity, to the point that they are used in battle only as a last resort in the direst of situations. This is not the case for the Chaos Empire, however, which somehow maintains a steady supply of horses for their numerous raiding parties. Those unaccustomed to the animals usually flee before them, their impressions not improved by the creaturesâ€™ fierce disposition and tendency to trample anything underfoot."
